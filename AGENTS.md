# AGENTS.md

Notes for agents working in this repository. `README.md` covers what the app is and how to run it.
This file covers the rules that are easy to break.

## Styling

Styling uses Tailwind (v4, set up in `src/styles.css` and `.postcssrc.json`): utility classes in
the templates, and no component `styles:` or `styleUrl` blocks. A component's own host styling goes
in `host: { class: '…' }`. Colours come from Tailwind's theme (`text-gray-500`, `bg-gray-50`), not
hex literals. Tailwind finds the classes in the inline templates by itself; a class written as a
string built at run time is not found, so write every class out in full.

## Pact contracts (epics qits-546, qits-112)

This app is a consumer of two providers. What it relies on from each is written down as a Pact V4
file in a folder of that provider's, and published as a jar the provider verifies in its own gate:

| Provider              | Store and pact spec                | Pact file                                           | Golden masters                  |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| qits-projects-service | `core/projects/projects.store*.ts` | `pacts/qits-landing-app_qits-projects-service.json` | `@qits/projects-golden-masters` |
| qits-githost-service  | `core/loc/loc.store*.ts`           | `pacts/qits-landing-app_qits-githost-service.json`  | `@qits/githost-golden-masters`  |

The githost pact has one interaction per kind of list a card meets, each from its own provider
state: every repository counted (the card shows "8 lines, 3 in tests"), one not counted yet
("Counting lines…"), one without a commit ("0 lines"), and a mix of counted and not counted
("at least 8 lines…"). The plain and screenshot specs cover the same cases from the same golden
masters.

- **Pacts name both sides by repository name**, never by application name, so a component's
  frontend and backend stay distinct: consumer `qits-landing-app`, provider
  `qits-projects-service`, file `pacts/<consumer>_<provider>.json`. The same names go into
  `comments.references` (`qits-call.app`, `qits-trigger.app`).
- **Stores are the only users of a generated client.** A guard or component asks a store; it never
  calls `src/app/api/` itself. So the pact spec next to the store is the whole of what this app
  relies on from that provider: `src/app/core/projects/projects.store.pact.spec.ts`.
- **The pact binds only what the app reads, and the compiler keeps it honest.** The golden master
  holds qits-projects' whole answer. `src/app/core/projects/projects.consumes.ts` lists, per call,
  the body paths the store reads (`as const`). The store wraps every client call in
  `consume(call, LIST)` (from `@qits/angular`), so its `data` is typed to those paths only: reading any other field, in the
  store or a template, fails the build. The pact spec passes the same lists as `consumes`, so the
  pact holds exactly those fields. To read another field, add it to the list; the pact changes
  with it. An empty list (`SESSION_CHECK`, and every error answer) binds the status only.
- **The pact spec uses `@pact-foundation/pact` (PactV4).** Each test drives one store method against
  the pact mock server, through a real `HttpClient` (`withFetch()`), and checks what the store made
  of the answer. The mock server answers with qits-projects' golden master and fails the test when
  the store's request does not match.
- **Answers come from the golden masters, never from a hand-written body.**
  `@qits/projects-golden-masters` is a devDependency, so qits-maintenance bumps it.
  `src/testing/golden-masters.ts` reads it. Plain specs (`projects.store.spec.ts`, `app.spec.ts`,
  `session.guard.spec.ts`) keep `HttpTestingController` and `flush(goldenMaster(...))`. A spec that
  needs a different answer derives it from a golden master and says how in a comment.
- **The generic part lives in `@qits/angular`**: `consume` and `Consumed` in the main entry, and
  the golden-master reader, `addGoldenInteraction` (with its required `consumes`) and
  `assertPactFile` in `@qits/angular/testing`. `src/testing/golden-masters.ts` only binds them to
  `@qits/projects-golden-masters`.
- **ESLint enforces the layout**: `eslint.config.mjs` turns on `@qits/angular/eslint`'s
  `recommended` rules (generated clients only in stores, every client call wrapped in `consume`,
  a pact spec beside every store, pact names are repository names). `npm run lint` runs prettier
  and ESLint, and the release check runs `npm run lint`.
- **Matchers come from the index's `frozen` lists**, never from a value's shape: `frozen.ids` a uuid
  regex, `frozen.instants` an ISO-8601 regex, every other leaf a type match, a recorded `null` exact
  `null`. `frozen.listFilteredTo` is "at least the recorded count"; every other array is "exactly
  the recorded count". Pact has no "type or null", so an array whose elements differ in which
  fields are null (repositories: the PROJECT one has no `component`) becomes `arrayContaining` with
  one variant per shape.
- **The interaction catalog is `src/app/interactions.ts`.** Every UI interaction that calls a
  backend has a stable slug there. `qits-trigger.interaction` names it, and a slug that is not in
  the catalog does not compile. Never reuse a slug for a different interaction.
- **Provider state params**: an id in the request path is a provider-state expression
  (`${projectId}`), but only when the path has a `{param}`. On a parameterless path pact-jvm
  resolves the expression to a path that misses the route.

### Keeping the committed pact current

The pact spec writes to a fresh temporary directory (pact-js merges into an existing file, which
would keep an interaction no test makes anymore). `afterAll` compares the result with the committed
file, ignoring `metadata` (library versions) and interaction order, and fails on any other
difference. If the change is intended, regenerate the file in the same change:

    QITS_GOLDEN_UPDATE=true npm test

The QA step runs `npm test`, so a stale committed pact fails the release request. `pacts/` is in
`.prettierignore` because pact-js owns its layout.

The lockfile holds the pact native core for glibc (workstations) and musl (the `node:24-alpine` CI
image). Keep both when you update `@pact-foundation/pact`.

### Publishing: only when the pact changed

Every pact sits flat in `pacts/`, named `<consumer>_<provider>.json` by repository name.
`release.yml` declares one `contracts.pacts` entry per provider, keyed by the provider's repository
name (`qits-projects-service: { packages: [maven] }`), and carries no `release:` override — the `app`
archetype's release step runs as is. qits-ci packs only `pacts/*_<provider>.json` into that
provider's jar (at `pacts/<file>` on the classpath), names it by the two repository names
(`eu.wohlben.qits:qits-landing-app-pacts-qits-projects-service`, `…-pacts-qits-githost-service`) and
publishes it only when those files changed. So a change to one pact does not republish, and bump,
the other provider's jar. There is no
repository-side gate, jar builder or PUT sequence left to maintain: `.config/qits/pacts.sh`,
`.config/qits/pacts-jar.mjs` and `.config/qits/published-tree-changed.sh` are gone.

## Screenshot tests (`*.browser.spec.ts`)

Components are also tested in a real browser (Chromium, through Playwright and Vitest browser mode),
and each test compares a screenshot with a committed reference. `npm run test:browser` runs them;
`npm test` (jsdom) leaves them out. The release check runs `npm run --if-present test:browser` in a
step image that has Chromium, so a changed pixel fails the release request.

- **The backend answers are the providers' golden masters**, as everywhere else. The reader uses
  `node:fs`, so it runs on the Node side: `vitest-browser.config.ts` gives the browser a
  `goldenMaster` command, and a spec calls `await commands.goldenMaster(state, operationId)`, or
  `(state, operationId, 'qits-githost')` for qits-githost (from `vitest/browser`), and
  `flush(...)`es the result. The two providers' frozen ids are unrelated, so the card spec puts
  qits-githost's recorded entries under the project's recorded repository ids and says so. An error answer is only a status; the store reads
  no body from it.
- **The same pixels on every machine**: the font is Inter from `src/testing/browser/fonts/`, never a
  system font; animations and transitions are off (`src/testing/browser/setup.ts`); the viewport is
  800x600 (`angular.json`, target `test-browser`).
- **The renderer** is the image `qits/build-images/node-browser-base`: Node 24, Playwright's Chromium
  and a pinned font stack. CI's release check runs on it, and the workspace image is built FROM it,
  so both render the same pixels. `scripts/check-renderer.mjs` runs first and refuses a machine
  without `/etc/qits-renderer-provenance` (a workstation), a renderer that differs from
  `src/testing/browser/renderer.txt` (the one the references were made with), and a `playwright`
  package that is not the image's version. `playwright` is pinned exactly to that version.
- **References** are in `__screenshots__/` beside the spec, named `<name>-chromium-linux.png`, and
  are committed. CI only compares (`CI=true`): a mismatch or a missing reference fails, and nothing
  is written. A mismatch writes the actual image and the diff to `.vitest-attachments/` (ignored).
- **References are made by the platform, never by hand.** A qits-maintenance task, which an agent
  triggers for its release request, regenerates them (with `renderer.txt`) in the renderer image and
  joins the commit to that release request. Do not commit reference screenshots made anywhere else.
