/**
 * What a store reads from a backend answer, stated once and enforced by the compiler (epic
 * qits-546).
 *
 * A store lists the body paths it reads, as an `as const` array, and wraps each generated client
 * call in {@link consume} with that list. The answer's `data` is then typed {@link Consumed}: only
 * the listed paths exist on it, so reading anything else fails `tsc` and Angular's strict
 * templates. The store's pact spec passes the same list as `consumes`, so the pact binds exactly
 * what the code reads, and the two cannot drift. `qits/consume-client-calls` (in
 * `@qits/angular/eslint`) makes every client call in a store go through `consume`.
 *
 * Paths are dot-separated keys; `[]` after a key steps into the elements of an array:
 *
 * - `project.name`: that field (a whole object or array, if that is what it holds);
 * - `entries[].project.id`: that field in every element of `entries`;
 * - `entries[]`: the elements themselves, without any of their fields (the store counts them).
 *
 * An empty list means the store reads nothing from the body (the status, at most).
